2	Organisational Controls	Annex A 5.1	Policies for Information Security	Information security policy and topic-specific policies shall be defined, approved by management, published, communicated to and acknowledged by relevant personnel and relevant interested parties, and reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur.	We need to have policies, and MIR records in SDC tool to prove their existence. The policies need to be MICs, just like the personnel an the parties.  We need a standardized routine according to a workflow template for creating these policies.  We need CHM records in the SDC tool that demonstrate we have created policies with that standardized routine. The standardized routine must reflect the requirements mentioned in the control.  There is a profile for this responsibility and that profile is assigned to at least one staff member. The review of these policies must then be organized.
